# Starting a Node Project
Starting a Node Project
To start a Node project, you need to create a package.json file, which serves as a manifest for the project's dependencies and metadata. The package.json file is a crucial component of a Node.js project.

To create a package.json file and initialize a Node project in your current working directory, use the following command in the terminal:

```
$ npm init
```

By running npm init, you will be prompted to enter the necessary details for your project. This includes information such as the project name, version, description, entry point file, author, license, and more. You can provide these details by answering the prompts in the terminal.

For example:

```
name: my-node-project
version: 1.0.0
description: A sample Node.js project
entry point: index.js
author: John Doe
license: MIT
```

After providing the required information, the npm init process will generate a package.json file in your current directory. Upon opening the package.json file, you will see that the details you entered during the prompt in the terminal are now populated within the file.

The package.json file plays a vital role in managing dependencies, scripts, and other project configurations. It allows you to specify the dependencies required for your project, define scripts for running various tasks, and provide metadata about your project.

The first step when starting a new Node.js project is to create a package.json file using npm init. It sets up the foundation for managing your project and its dependencies effectively.
