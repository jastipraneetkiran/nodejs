# Confirming Installation

To verify that Node is successfully installed on your machine and to check the installed version, you can use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```
$ node -v

```

After running this command, you should see the version number of Node printed in the terminal.

For example, if Node v18.16.0 is installed, the output will be:
>v18.16.0

Congratulations! You now have the proper setup on your machine, and you are ready to proceed with the course.
