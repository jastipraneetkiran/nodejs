# Course Overview, Objectives and Timing
As the language of the Internet browser, JavaScript is ubiquitous and Node.js is an asynchronous, event-driven, JavaScript runtime.

Software engineers from all backgrounds have touched JavaScript at some point. Using a common-place, easy-to-learn language as the basis of a runtime environment for manipulating machine I/O has some interesting and wide-ranging productivity benefits.

Node.js has qualities that can make it particularly useful in various scenarios. From service-mocking, rapid-prototyping and real-time applications to building Command Line Interfaces in a short time to accessing a plethora of ecosystem utilities. This course allows the learner to learn about the fundamentals of Node.js and discover ways it can help in everyday computing scenarios.

## By the end of this course, you should be able to:

- Rapidly build command line tools.
- Rapidly mock RESTful JSON APIs.
- Rapidly prototype real-time services.
- Discover and use ecosystem utilities.

The chapters in the course have been designed to build on one another. It is probably best to work through them in sequence; if you skip or only skim some chapters quickly, you may find there are topics being discussed you have not been exposed to yet. But this is all self-paced, you can always go back, thread your own path through the material, and return to exactly where you left off when you come back to start a new session. However, we still suggest you avoid long breaks in between periods of work, as learning will be faster and content retention improved.
